# Bike Rental
This application will allow you to view where the bikes originate from.

Get the trip info

Rider info

The application is not finished as of yet. I ran out of time. However 
everything should be testable on a local machine at least for the routes.
I didn't get a chance to add authentication. I started the process.


# How to use the app
You will sign up. You will need to provide a username and password
You can visit `localhost:3000/station/:id` to view the station by id
(NOTE: I was not able to implement the actual json web link provided)

The endpoints are as follows:
1. `localhost:3000/station/:id`
2. `localhost:3000/rider`
